# 🏆 BhaskarMath Academy
> **Empowering students through AI-driven advanced mathematics.**

Welcome to **BhaskarMath**, an educational organization dedicated to making complex mathematics accessible, interactive, and easy to learn. Our flagship project uses Artificial Intelligence to solve and teach advanced equations step-by-step.



## 🌟 Key Features
* **AI Teacher:** Get detailed, human-like explanations for any math problem.
* **Step-by-Step Logic:** We don't just give the answer; we show the path.
* **Gold Standard UI:** A high-end, Dark Gold interface designed for focus and clarity.
* **Advanced Rendering:** Perfect mathematical notation using KaTeX ($LaTeX$).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
The BhaskarMath ecosystem is built with a powerful blend of technologies:

| Category | Technology |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | HTML5, CSS3 (Dark Gold Theme), JavaScript (ES6+) |
| **AI Engine** | Google Gemini 1.5 Flash API |
| **Math Engine** | Math.js & SymPy |
| **Notation** | KaTeX ($LaTeX$ rendering) |
| **Hosting** | GitHub Pages / Firebase |

## 🚀 How it Works
1.  **Input:** The student enters an equation (e.g., $x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0$).
2.  **Processing:** Our JS engine cleans the input and sends it to the **Gemini AI**.
3.  **Instruction:** The AI acts as a professor, explaining the specific rules (like the Bhaskara formula) before showing the numbers.
4.  **Display:** The solution is rendered beautifully on the screen for the student to study.
